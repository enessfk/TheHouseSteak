## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
  
### Prerequisites

To run this project in production or development mode you have to make sure, [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed on your computer. If you opted to install an older version of Python, it is possible that it did not come with `Pip` preinstalled.

- To check Python and Pip are installed on your machine:
```bash
# Python
python --version

# Pip
pip --version
```
### Installation

To get this project, clone the repository directly using git or download a zip copy from the [master branch on Github](https://github.com/enessfk/TheHouseSteak/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enessfk/TheHouseSteak.git TheHouseSteak
```

Instead of using the operating system-wide defined Python to install all the dependencies, you can create a virtual environment to keep all the required dependencies for your project separate from your other projects. To install virtualenv package:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
In a terminal, run the following command to create virtual environment in the base directory of this project:

```bash
virtualenv venv
```
This command will create a new `venv` folder in your project directory. You can activate the python environment by running the following command:

```bash
# Mac OS or Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```
You should see the name of your virtual environment in brackets on your terminal line e.g. (venv).

To install the dependencies, run this from the command-line:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The project is now ready to run. To run the project, run this command in the directory where the `manage.py` file is located:
 
 ```bash
python manage.py runserver
 ```

## Usage
There are several users defined in the project, one of which is admin. 
All these users have the same passwords. Required user information to login both the admin panel and the web application:

> **Username :** *admin* <br>
> **Password :** *housesteak16*

You can access the django admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin.
